Do I even really need to explain this to anyone looking at this? I am almost
pretty certain that anyone who is a Computer programmer knows what bigint. But I
guess for those of you who don't I will explain.

The bigint data type is used to store numbers lager than what the default int
c++ can provide. 

Be Warned some of the files in are not mine. They are the test files provide by
the CS Department at my University. I really don't think they will care if they
appear here. They are only files that contain assertions to make that the
program works which it does. 

Well that is all I want to say for now.
