This is a string class implementation done for my CS2 class at Kent State
Univerity. The string class uses a dynamically allocated char array to store the
data that is needed. 

Here is what is implemented:
The default constructor
A C-string constructor
A Char constructor
A constructor that builds a string of just a specified size
The destructor
The concatenation operator
The subscript operator
All the comparsion operators like:
	==(is equal)
	<(less than)
	>(greater than)
	<=(less than or equal to)
	>=(greater than or equal to)
	!=(not equal)
a length function
substring
find string
find char
overloaded output and input operators
swap 
assignment 
copy constructor
atoi(ascii to integer)
getline
split 

I will be adding a minus operator that will remove a certain pattern from a
string entirely.
