This is the bigint class minus dealing with negative integers. The bigint class
allows the integers larger than what the built in integer class for c++ can deal
with. 

This bigint implementation deals with using a staticly defined integer array to
store each digit in the number. Currently it can only with numbers with 300
digits in them.

This implementation includes adding two bigints together, multipling a bigint by
an integer, and multiplying to bigints together. 

I plan on adding negative integers, subtraction, division, powers, and all the
comparsion operators. I will also be converting from a staticly defined integer
array to a dynamically allocated one.
